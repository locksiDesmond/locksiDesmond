### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm Desmond!

I'm a Full stack developer who have passion for user friendly interfaces. I´m based on the Internet but I live in Lagos, Nigeria.

My friend calls me Wolf Of Silicon Valley because of my amazing work ethics and strong will to get things done. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code (cliché right?). ✨😍 Software development is exhilarant because you can never really get bored unless you're scared to try out new things. 


### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my React skills: NextJS, Create-react-app and React Native.<br />
I'd also picked some exicting technologies like Graph-Ql, Node (express), and couple of databases like Mongo, <br/> Postgres Sql, Fauna Db (I saw a youtube video about it once and it's fascinating).<br/>
BTW, SVG's are cool and I'll be getting into it.<br/>

### Personal projects 😃🧾

I've gotten the opportunity to work on different projects, all of which are interesting and took me on a different journey, learn new things and have fun while at it. I enjoy the process a little bit more than i enjoy the outcome.
- [Sorosoke app](https://github.com/viubi/sorosoke-frontend) - A website that supports the advocate of good governance and a better Nigeria.
- [Untitled](http://feguber.vercel.app/) - An ecommerce platform.
- [Locksi page](https://github.com/locksiDesmond/google-pages) - Trust me it works.
- [Calculator](https://github.com/locksiDesmond/calculator) - I made this during black lives matter (2020) (I added a little incentive).
- [Amazing todo app](https://github.com/locksiDesmond/Todo) - description cannot be blank.

### What's Next? 
I never think of the future - it comes soon enough. (Albert Einstein)
