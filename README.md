TLDR:

<!-- I'm a Full Stack Developer who contributes to open source and is passionate about learning in order to enhance user experience and offer the highest caliber of services. I´m based on the Internet but I live in [state], Nigeria. 

My friend refers to me as the "Wolf of Silicon Valley" because of my incredible work ethic and determination to complete tasks. I've had the opportunity to become deeply involved in a variety of works and projects, all of which aim to improve the world a little bit through design and code (cliche, no?). Software development is exciting because there is always room for improvement and it never gets old.

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

I now have three years of React experience, but that is just the start. I still have a ton to learn, and I won't be stopping anytime soon. <br /> 
Additionally, I chose other exciting technologies, such as Graph-Ql, Node (express), Mongo, Postgres SQL, and Fauna Db (which I haven't been able to use). 
I increased the integrity of my code over the past year by making sure to implement tests. Now that the code has been thoroughly tested, I can sleep better at night.

I intended to assume more responsibility and leadership roles. I'm working on it but I can't say any more than this right now. <br/> 
I also aim to assist quite a few developers in becoming recognized in the programming profession (more on this later too). <br/>

BTW, SVG's are cool and I'll love to work on a project that requires it.<br/>
2021, I didn't release any personal project because i've was busy however intended to work on a couple of project (individually or with friends). -->

<!-- ### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- React Native
- Technical Writing (I published an article on [hashnode](http://locksi.hashnode.dev/))
- Django

<!-- ### Personal projects 😃🧾 

I've had the chance to work on a variety of interesting projects that have each taken me on a unique journey, learned new things, and it's been enjoyable.  I like the process a  little bit more than I like the result..  P.S. This is outdated because I worked on these projects before 2021.
- [Sorosoke app](https://sorosoke.netlify.app/) - A website that supports the advocate of good governance and a better Nigeria.
- [create-animation-ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-animation-ws) - A NPM package that supplies a basic template for HTML, GSAP and scrollTrigger.
- [Untitled](http://feguber.vercel.app/) - An ecommerce platform.
- [Locksi page](https://github.com/locksiDesmond/google-pages) - Trust me it works.
- [Calculator](https://locksidesmond.github.io/calculator/) - I made this during black lives matter (2020) (I added an easter egg).
- [Amazing todo app](https://todo-lemon.vercel.app/) - description cannot be blank. -->

### Fun fact ⚡

There's hardly anything I'm not interested in, Humor me. My interest range across different discipline. I've enjoy reading about philosophy, psychology, movie production, arts, music and sports. (This is susceptible to change).

I put easter eggs in my early works but i've not been able to do that in recent time.But, I'll try to do that more. -->
