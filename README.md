### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, Have you met Desmond?

I'm a Full stack developer, open source contributor, who is passionate on learning so as to improve user experience and provide the best quality in services. I¬¥m based on the Internet but I live in [state], Nigeria.

My friend calls me Wolf Of Silicon Valley because of my amazing work ethics and strong will to get things done. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code (clich√© right?). Software development is exhilarant because It never get boring and there are still alot of it that needs improvement. 


### What I'm focusing on üë®‚Äçüíª

Currently, I can boast of 3 years React experience but that's just the beginning. There's still so much I want to learn and i'm not stopping anytime soon.<br />
I'd also picked some exicting technologies like Graph-Ql, Node (express), Mongo, <br/> Postgres Sql, Fauna Db (I've not been able to use this).<br/>
In the past year, I improved my code integrity by ensuring to add tests. Now I sleep better at night knowing the code are well tested.

I intended to take on more leadership position and responsibilty. I can't share more than this at the moment but i'm working on it.<br/>
Also, I want to help quite a number of developers make thier mark in the programming industry (more on this later too). <br/>

BTW, SVG's are cool and I'll love to work on a project that requires it.<br/>
2021, I didn't release any personal project because i've was busy however intended to work on a couple of project (individually or with friends).

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning

### Personal projects üòÉüßæ

I've gotten the opportunity to work on different projects, all of which are interesting and took me on a different journey, learn new things and have fun while at it. I enjoy the process a little bit more than I enjoy the outcome.

### Fun fact ‚ö°

There's hardly anything I'm not interested in, Humor me. My interest range across different discipline. I've enjoy reading about philosophers, psychology, movie production, arts, music and sports. (This is susceptible to change

I always try to put easter eggs in my early works. I'll try to do that more.
